```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(Stat302Project03)
```

```{r}
my_t.test(my_gapminder$lifeExp, "two.sided", 60)  # P = 0.09322877
my_t.test(my_gapminder$lifeExp, "less", 60)       # P = 0.04661438
my_t.test(my_gapminder$lifeExp, "greater", 60)    # P = 0.9533856
```
With \code{cut-off = 0.05}, we are 95% confident that the observed mean is
less than 60.
With \code{cut-off = 0.05}, we are 95% confident that the observed mean does
not equal to 60.
With \code{cut-off = 0.05}, we have a \code{p-value} larger than \code{cut-off value},
we cannot draw conclusion from this result.

```{r}
my_lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap + continent, data = my_gapminder)
